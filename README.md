# PrivaSEE
PrivaSEE is a functional web app that helps users understand the privacy implications of the legal user agreements for a wide range of websites and apps. It features an interactive chatbot, and a searchable database of legal agreements. The app was built with an LLM designed to interpret legal text, and was fine-tuned using the database, letter grades, and annotations published by the non-profit project [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/en/frontpage).

This project is a work in progress, and this repository will be actively updated.
